# This directory is excluded from the dotfiles repo, which means any files in here
# will not be persisted across other installations of the dotfiles.

# Place here anything that is only relevant to this machine and not to others.

# This file is purposefully a zsh file so the glob pattern in load_nested.zsh
# always finds something instead of printing an annoying error
